    | The current control flow of dialogue is:
    | 1.  A chat comes in and Dialogue manager reads it or the bot triggers a
    |    dialogue because of memory/perception/task state
    | 2.  The dialogue manager puts a DialogueObject on the DialogueStack.
    | 3.  The DialogueStack calls .step() which in turn calls the DialogueObject.step()
    |    that performs some action as implemented in the step method. The step could
    |    also possibly interact with the agent's memory. And finally the step() makes
    |    a call and decides if the DialogueObject is finished.
    |
    |
    | -   The step() returns a string:  maybe_chat, a dict: maybe_data.
    | -   The step()'s outputs are read by the manager which can decide to put another
    |    DialogueObject on the stack.

    | The maybe_data from the output of the dialogue object's step() can
    | contain a 'push' key; this overrides the manager's decision on what to push to
    | the stack.

    | Control flow for interpreter and clarification:
    | The interpreter is also a kind of DialogueObject, and a clarification step is
    | the interpreter returning control to the DialogueManager, which pushes a
    | ConfirmTask or ConfirmReferenceObject as a DialogueObject onto the DialogueStack.
